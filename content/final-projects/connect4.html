# The _Connect 4_ Tournament

At the end of this course, selected and interested students will have the opportunity to program their own Connect 4 AI player. The Connect 4 AI's will compete against each other in a Connect 4 tournament that will be held during the night of the LEGO Robot Round-Up. The AI programs will be moderated by a program that will simply tell the AI's what move their opponent made and ask them what move they want to make in response.
