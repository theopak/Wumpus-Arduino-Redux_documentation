<div class="hero-unit">
  <p>At the end of this course, selected and interested students will have the opportunity to program their own <strong>Connect 4 AI player</strong>. The Connect 4 AIs will compete against each other in a Connect 4 tournament that will be held during the night of the LEGO Robot Round-Up. The AI programs will be moderated by a program that will simply tell the AIs what move their opponent made and ask them what move they want to make in response.</p>
