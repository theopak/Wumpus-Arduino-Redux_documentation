# Writing, Downloading, and Running Programs in Interactive C

    <pre class="prettyprint">
    #use sony-ir.icb

    void main() {
      while(1) {
        sony_init(1);
        printf("\nMy Program Name\n"); //You can change this to be whatever
        while(!start_button());
        printf(“Running\n”);
        while(!stop_button()) {
          //YOUR CODE GOES HERE
          //it will run until the stop button is pressed
        }
        sony_init(0);
      }
    }
    </pre>

8. Click "Stop" to stop execution
9. Every time you change your program you have to do steps 4-7 again


# Running Your Program When Disconnected
1. You can run your program without the Handy Board being connected the computer. To do so first turn off the handy board, then disconnect the telephone wire that is plugged into it.
2. When it turns on it will immediately start executing your main() function, and if you used the code skeleton above should display “My Program Name” or whatever you put in that first printf statement.
3. When you press start it should print “Started” and then run your code until you press the stop button when it will display “My Program Name” again and wait for you to press the start button to run it again. This will continue until you turn it off.
4. If it doesn’t turn on, you have to charge the battery by directly plugging the power cord into the handy board power jack.
