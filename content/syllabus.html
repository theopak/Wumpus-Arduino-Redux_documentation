## Introduction

What are minds? Are minds physical or non-physical? Does consciousness have a physical basis? If minds are purely physical, do we have free will? If we don't have free will, do we have moral responsibilities or rights? Who or what are we anyway? How is our personal identity defined? What is the boundary between us and our environment? How close are we to building a computer with capabilities similar to those of Commander Data as depicted in Star Trek NG? Should it share the same basic rights and responsibilities as those possessed by humans? Moreover, if we can "build a person" or, perhaps, "build better persons" (cyborgs, genetic engineering, nanotechnology), is this something we should do? Or, should we prohibit such attempts? How about non-human-animals? To what extent are they conscious and aware, and to what extent does that give them rights?

If you are interested in exploring some of these conceptual and ethical questions regarding the nature of mind, this course will get you jump-started. Students meet twice a week in small sections to have class discussions and debates about these issues. On thursday evenings, all sections come together to listen to a guest speaker talk about their research on the frontiers of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, or to watch a movie that is particularly relevant to the topic at hand. During the course, students will learn how make a philosophical argument, and how to express them in writing or through an oral presentation. Final projects are hands-on: build an "intelligent" Lego Robot, write an AI program (one option is to program a Connect-4 AI), or actively participate in a cognitive psychology experiment.


## Requirements

This course is a freshmen-only, [Communication Intensive](http://srfs.rpi.edu/update.do?artcenterkey=208&setappvar=page(1)) course, and is taught every Fall semester. The course is a survey course on classical and contemporary issues in philosophy of mind, cognition science, and artificial intelligence, and serves as a springboard to other courses in philosophy, psychology, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. Indeed, after taking this course, some students may be interested in joining the [Minds & Machines Program in Cognitive Science and Cognitive Technology](http://www.mm.rpi.edu/), or even declare a major or minor in ]philosophy](http://www.cogsci.rpi.edu/pl/bs-philosophy), [psychology](http://www.cogsci.rpi.edu/pl/bs-psychology), or [cognitive science](http://www.cogsci.rpi.edu/pl/bs-cognitive-science-coming). Occasionaly, a non-freshmen section of this course will be offered under PHIL-1120 Minds and Machines. However, non-freshmen committed to pursuing this area of study can be added to an existing freshmen instruction with the approval from the instructor. Students cannot obtain credit for both IHSS-1964 Minds and Machines and PHIL 1120 Minds and Machines.


## Learning Outcomes

Minds & Machines is a [First Year Studies course](http://www.hass.rpi.edu/pl/year-studies). First Year Studies courses feature "personal attention" and "active learning" and aim to encourage a sense of community and love of learning among first year students at Rensselaer. First Year Studies courses are interdisciplinary courses that aim to both introduce students to current areas of interdisciplinary research and help students to obtain many of the fundamental academic/intellectual skills they will need in order to be successful at Rensselaer and beyond. As such, STUDENTS WHO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE MINDS & MACHINES WILL DEMONSTRATE A HIGH LEVEL OF PROFICIENCY AT:

* Examining/investigating fundamental issues relating to "minds and machines" and cognitive science in a critical, comprehensive and humane fashion and expressing the results of their investigations in both written and oral forms of media;
* Distinguishing and evaluating arguments/evidence, unpacking fundamental assumptions and comparing/contrasting views/values that any such fundamental investigation requires;
* Working together with others as both a team member and leader;
* Recognizing and critically reflecting on the diversity of outlooks to which fundamental questions (such as those relating to "minds and machines" and cognitive science) often give rise;
* Applying various aspects of what is learned in Minds & Machines in final projects such as:
* Participating/conducting in a cognitive science experiment;
* Designing an "artificially intelligent" LEGO robot that masters the Wumpus World;
* Designing intelligent computer software;
* Researching fundamental questions relating to "minds and machines;


## A Note on the Instructors

There are three different instructors for this course. Despite their best efforts, it is sometimes hard to synchronize their efforts. In particular, coming from different backgrounds and holding different ideas regarding the need or importance of certain readings and assignments, there will be small differences in the specific nature of readings and assignments between the different instructors. However, for the most part the readings and assignments between the different sections are the same, and both instructors follow the basic topic schedule as laid out below.


## Texts

* **A. Fahey and van Heuveln**, [Critical Wisdom Primer](http://www.cogsci.rpi.edu/~heuveb/Teaching/CriticalWisdom/Primer.html)
* **B. Leiber**, _Can Animals and Machines be Persons?_
* **C. Buchanan**, _Better Than Human_
* **D. Baron-Cohen**, _The Essential Difference_

## Assignments

There are 4 types of assignment:

A. NOTEBOOK QUESTIONS -
There will be a small number of notebook questions that will require you to write a somewhat lengthy (about 4 pages) yet organized paper. These notebook questions mainly test your understanding of the material read and discussed in class, and your ability to communicate these different ideas and arguments.

B. SHORT ASSIGNMENTS -
There will be several short assignments interspersed throughout the semester. These assignments may include take-home questions about the reading, little in-class quizzes about the reading, and short (1 page) open response papers regarding the Thursday evening lectures.

C. GROUP PROJECT PRESENTATION -
You and your group will give a presentation on one of a variety of topics concerning the nature of intelligence, personhood, and rights.

D. FINAL PROJECT or PAPER -
You will do ONE of the following:

1. Participate in the design of "intelligent" computer software;
2. Conduct and/or participate in a psychological experiment;
3. Design a LEGO Robot to perform a specified task;
4. Write a philosophical paper (typed, 1500-2500 words) on some aspect of "Minds & Machines."
5. A project that you propose and develop in consultation with the instructor.


## Grading

Roughly, each of the 4 types of assignment is worth between 20 and 30% of your grade. At the instructors’ discretion, points will be added to the student's final average in recognition of outstanding class participation or other forms of contribution to the class. Finally, attendance is mandatory for all sections, and missing classes will adversely effect your grade.

Final grades as well as grades on individual assignments will be assigned in accord with the following guidelines:

A- = 90-92%,  A =93% and above
Outstanding work. The student has completed all facets of the assignment(s) and has shown a full and subtle understanding of the subject matter that is original and thought provoking. The student’s work exhibits clarity and fluency of expression and contains only very minor errors of grammar or style.

B- = 80-82%, B =83-86%, B+ =87-89%
Highly satisfactory work. The student has completed most all facets of the assignment(s) and has shown a full understanding of the subject matter. The student’s work exhibits clarity of expression and contains only minor errors of grammar or style.

C- = 70-72%, C =73-76%, C+ =77-79%
Minimally satisfactory work. The student has completed the critical facets of the assignment(s) and has shown an adequate understanding of the subject matter. The student’s work exhibits clarity of expression as regards those critical facets but that clarity may be partially diminished by errors of grammar or style.

D = 60-66%, D+ =67-69%
Unsatisfactory work. The student has failed to complete some of the critical facets of the assignment(s) and has shown a less than adequate understanding of the subject matter. The student’s work exhibits clarity of expression as regards only some of those critical facets and that clarity may be largely diminished by errors of grammar or style.

F = 0-59%
Failure. The student has failed to complete many of the critical facets of the assignment(s) and has shown little understanding of the subject matter. The student’s work exhibits little clarity of expression as regards those critical facets and that clarity may be largely diminished by errors of grammar or style. “Failure,” either for the assignment or, at the instructor’s discretion, for the course, is also assigned in the case of cheating/plagiarism.

If you have questions, or need further information, please ask your instructor.


## Honesty, Integrity, and Respect

One of the aims of this course is the fostering of the student's ability to think critically, creatively and independently. While everyone is aware that such thinking does not take place in a vacuum, it is ultimately the student's responsibility to ensure that the "ideas" expressed in written work are essentially those of the student, or, if they are the "ideas of others," that their sources are properly cited. Knowing disregard of this principle counts as ACADEMIC DISHONESTY and may result in course failure. The student is encouraged to examine Rensselaer's policies regarding academic integrity in the current editions of the [Rensselaer Handbook](http://www.rpi.edu/dept/doso/handbook.html) and the Rensselaer Undergraduate Catalog.

Among the requirements for both the student and the instructors in this course is that we do our best to respect the dignity of ourselves and all persons. Words or deeds directed against a person or group, where it is obvious that the sole intent is to insult or otherwise do them harm in a thoroughly unconstructive manner, will not be tolerated. In a similar vein, we should do our best to sensitize ourselves to the unfair and derogatory racial, religious and sexual connotations of various English expressions and eliminate those expressions from casual use. Having said this, however, it must also be said that it is crucial to Rensselaer's mission that there be placed no undue constraint on the free expression of ideas and opinions. Thus, the mere fact that someone considers an expression or act false or offensive is not by itself sufficient to warrant sanction. Help (online as well as in person) with writing and other forms of expression can be found at the [Center for Communication Practices](http://www.ccp.rpi.edu/).
